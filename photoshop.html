				<h3>Photoshop</h3>
				<p>I enjoy the unusual and creative things you can do in Photoshop. You are able to take a real photo and place it into a situation and context that was not thought possible. Where the laws of physics, and plausabilities and restrictions do not apply. The gallery below shows the various photoshoped images I have completed, most are quite obvious of this fact. Make sure you hover over the images. </p> 
                
                   <p>The top left is a bizarre image, highlighting the power of photoshop.</p>
                   
  <p>The top right is a scanned image of my family that was cleaned and re-coloured. Clive Stone (left), Charles (Chris) Stone, father of Valentine Stone (middle) and Valentine (Val) Stone (right). The image was taken around 1961, give or take a few years. Please note the bottom two images are in black and white, and will not change when hovered over.</p>
