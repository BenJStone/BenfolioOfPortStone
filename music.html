				<h3>Percussion/Drums</h3>
				<p>An important part of my life is percussion. I continue to drum in a jazz band and a New Orlean's fanfare band. I am also a percussionist in an orchestra. I definetlely enjoy myself when performing or taking part in these activities.</p>
                
                
                <p> In our jazz band, <i> "Froggers"</i>, the "rhythm section" as we like to be known as, consists of five instruments. These are the drums, piano, rhythm guitar, double bass and vibest. We perform in school concerts as well as national competitions, such as "Generations in Jazz", hosted in Mount Gambier each year. We practice and perform artists such as Charles Mingus, Duke Ellington, Art Tatum and Count Basie.</p>
                
                <p>The Brass Fanefare Band involves secondline drumming and New Orlean's Style Jazz, a great combo that sounds great. In this band, I am just on the snare drum. The band in total consists of 2 trombonist, 2 trumpeters, 1 tenor saxophonist, 1 sausaphone/tuba, bass drum and cymbol player and snare drum player. An inpiration are the "Rebirth Brass Band".</p>
                
                <p>Leading percussion in an orchestra is another great experiance I am lucky to have. With an orchesta the dynamics (both musically and as a whole group) are vastly different to a band. Firstly for a percussionist, there are vastly differnt instruments to specialise in. The timpani or xylophone for instance require different skills. Personally, I am mostly commonly required as a timpanist. Although, I also help out with all the auxillary percussion (such as triangles and vibraslap) and the mallet percussion (mainly cymbols). It is challenge at times, but well worth it. I enjoy the diversity of music that I have every week from joining these groups and it means you are always learning new things aswell.   
                <p> I am very fortunate I have music. It is crazy hoe music can express what cannot be put into words. I'll finish with some wise words from Miles Davis and Yip Harburg...
                <ul><b><i>"When you hit a wrong note, it's the next note that makes it good or bad." - Miles Thomas</i></b></ul>
               
                <ul><b><i>"Words make you think a thought. Music makes you feel a feeling. A song makes you feel a thought." - Yip Harburg</i></b></ul>

				<h3>Musescore</h3>
				<p>I have spent many hours on Musescore. In effort to create music, I have used this software for both notation and also for production. This is a program that is closest to the standard score that historically, composers would uses to create music. That is, every note, melody and rhythm has to be transcriped in and make sense with the other instruments. Another great feature of this program, is that it is free!</p>
                <p>My first song, named appropriately as "Song 1", was made entirely on Musescore. It is a classical song in the key of C at 110 beats per minute. The song is played prodominently by the sting and percussion section. The main instruments are the cellos, violins, timpani (even featuring a timpani solo), bass drum and snare drum. I'll admit the song is a little too serious for my liking.</p>

                <p>The song "Lord of the Jazz" was a variation on the original anglican song "Lord of the Dance". It was group project and the result came out pretty good. We are now looking to extend this projcet and explore ther genres such as ska, reggae, funk and metal.</p>

            <p>Jive Dive is another jazz piece I have been working on. It uses the jungle drum feel with a strong, leading bass line. I was inspired by Charles Mingus, trying to replicate the crazy, chaoticness that he is well known for, particually for the brass and woodwind.

				<h3>Fruity Loops</h3>
				<p>Fruity loops is one of the best DAW and production software around. It is made by image-line. It is fun to play with, however I am still new and am learning a lot.</p>
                <p>There is a wide range of sounds available to you, almost an infinite number, due to all the customisation and effects you can add. You can even change the shape of a soundwave!
                <p> Here is part of one of my tracks that I am yet to finish.</p>
