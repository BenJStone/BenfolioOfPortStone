						<h3>Welcome...</h3>
						<p>To my personal multimedia site. Here I display all my work and effort. It is my best intention to keep this site up to date and relevent for the future ahead.</p>
                        
       <p>The website has been designed and kept up to date by Ben Stone. Some niche features of the site include responsiveness and a .gif behind most of the headers.
        <p>If you haven't noticed already, I have switched the words "Ben" and "Port" from the words "Stone" and "Folio" respectively. It's more interesting that way. Some of my recent projects are below.</p>
